# Data Scientist Portfolio

## Explanation of basic concepts:

### 1. Non-linear Regression:
First project based on China's GDP from 1960 to 2014 dataset. This data helps me to practice using non-linear functions in order to adjust the appropriate model to the  existing trend in the data set. As the result, I used logistic function due to the similarity of the function's shape to model's trend. Next, the parameters of the  functions were optimized and the functions were visualized after the changes were made. The result was satisfactory, therefore the prediction model was implemented and the data set was divided into training and test sets. After the learning process and the test, it was found that the solution presents the following results:

* Mean absolute error: 6.816782828315826e-10
* Mean squared error: 7.75095678657296e-19
* r2_score: 1.0


## End-to-end projects:

### 1. COVID-19 Vaccination Project:

The project is intended to initiate tasks that are the responsibility of Data Scientists. In the case of this project, I went all the way from searching and importing basic data, through their analysis, cleaning and unification, as well as modification, to using the information in analysis and visualization in PowerBI.
