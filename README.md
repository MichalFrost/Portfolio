# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Project 1:
* First project based on China's GDP from 1960 to 2014. This dataset helps me to practice using non-linear functions in order to adjust the appropriate model to the 
* existing trend in the data set. As the result, I used logistic function due to the similarity of the function's shape to model's trend. Next, the parameters of the 
* functions were optimized and the functions were visualized after the changes were made. The result was satisfactory, therefore the prediction model was implemented and
* the data set was divided into training and test sets. After the learning process and the test, it was found that the solution presents the following results:

* Mean absolute error: 6.816782828315826e-10
* Mean squared error: 7.75095678657296e-19
* r2_score: 1.0
