Data Scientist - is the person who exploit data, access databases, use pipeline outputs and has a strong analytical skills.

Data Engineer - is the person who ingest and store data, set up databases, build data pipelines and has a strong software skills.

ETL framework for designing data pipelines:
- Extract data
- Transform extracted data
- Load transformed data to another database

Data Structures:
- Structured Data - easy to search and organize, difined types, grouped, about 20% of data is organized.
- Semi-structured Data - different observations have different sizes (like one id has 2 favourites artists and another one has 5 of them).
- Unstructured Data - usually text, sound, pictures or video.

What about this?
- Data Lakes - stores all raw data, difficult to analyze, cost-effective, relatively HUGE, real-time analytics.
- Data Warehouses - store only specific data, optimized for data anlysis, relatively small
- Databases - general term to defined as organized data stored.
- Data Catalog - it helps to understand data lakes, support with data usage, data sources, how often the data is updated, by whom. Enrusers reproducibility. 

Scheduling Data:
- Batches - group records at intervals, often cheaper
- Streams - send individual records right away
