## 1. Matrices & Linear Algebra Fundamentals

### About

In mathematics, a matrix is a __rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns__. A matrix could be reduced as a submatrix of a matrix by deleting any collection of rows and/or columns.

## 2. Hash Functions, Binary Tree, O(n)

A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has a maximum of two children: left and right. This tree allows you to store data in a hierarchical form, which is useful for searching, sorting and organizing data.

Time complexity (O):
- Insertion, search, deletion: O(log n) for a balanced tree (e.g. AVL or red-black tree).
- O(n) for unbalanced trees (where all elements are in one line to form a list).
- 
Usage examples: Binary trees are commonly used to implement structures such as BST trees (binary search trees), which efficiently store structured data.
